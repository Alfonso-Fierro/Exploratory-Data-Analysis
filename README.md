# Exploratory Data Analysis

This project focuses on detecting outliers in datasets and generating synthetic data through various methodologies. 

## Key Features:

- **Estimation of Distributional Properties:** Utilizing robust and non-parametric estimators to estimate distributional properties.
  
- **Outlier Detection:** Employing methods such as minimum variance and Mahalanobis metric for identifying outliers within the data.
  
- **Data Reconstruction and Simulation:** Techniques for reconstructing and simulating data from censored information or frequency tables.
